# Energy-System-for-an-Electrically-Independent-Greenhouse
The project develops a system based on the use of: Photovoltaic Panels and Micro Wind Turbines, sized and chosen according to the energy demand of a Heat Pump, which is responsible for the internal climate control of the greenhouse.

The system's operating logic follows a precise energy hierarchy: the energy converted by the photovoltaic and wind power systems is sent to power the heat pump when necessary.
When there is no electricity consumption by users, the electricity is directed to recharge the batteries, thus providing a reserve supply.
Once the maximum charge is reached, the residual energy is exported to the grid.
Considering the critical condition in which production and storage are insufficient to cover demand, a variable that counts the purchase of electricity from the grid is integrated into the simulation. Depending on the case, this will be used both to power the heat pump and to recharge the batteries.

## 💻 Software 
- **TRNSYS 18** – dynamic system simulation
- **MATLAB** – pre-processing and writing cycles and equations
- **Excel** – data analysis

## ⚙️ Main Component of TRNSYS
- **Type 15(TESS)** - meteorology files
- **Type 562(TESS)** – photovoltaic panels
- **Type 48(TESS)** - photovoltaic system inverter
- **Type 90(TESS)** - wind turbines
- **Type 47(TESS)** - electric storage batteries

- **Type 165** - sensors and temperature control
- **Equation Block** - greenhouse model and electro-thermal calculations

## 🎯 Main Objectives
- Determine the possible seasonal (summer/winter) electricity consumption required by the heat pump and auxiliaries.
- Determine the amount of electricity generated by renewable energy sources.
- Make the system as efficient as possible in terms of cycles: heat pump on/off and battery charging/discharging.
- Make a brief assessment of the system's economy.

## 🧩 Plant Structure
- Photovoltaic surface area: 80 m^2
- Peak power of single photovoltaic module: 500 W
- Number of wind turbine(Darrieous model): 4
- Peak power of single wind turbine: 3000 W
- Rated heating capacity of heat pump: 9000 W
- Greenhouse surface area: 100 m^2

## 📊 Key Results
| Parameter | Value | Unit |

| Annual Electricity Demand | 15.2 | MWh |

| Annual Electricity Production | 46.1 | MWh |

| Annual Electricity Imports | 1.81 | MWh |

| Annual Electricity Export | 32.3 | MWh |

| Solar Fraction | >100% | / |

It is clear to see how the power produced drastically exceeds the power required, indicating that the plant is significantly oversized in relation to actual requirements.
This oversizing can be advantageous from an economic point of view, as the greater the export quota, the greater the economic return. On the other hand, from a technical point of view, oversizing is a problem, as the idea of powering a greenhouse takes a back seat.
To explain: if the goal is to export as much electrical power as possible, then it makes little sense to consume usable space by placing a greenhouse instead of additional plants. In these terms, one could simply reduce the size of the plants or increase the size of the greenhouse. Or, one could change the location of the greenhouse, and therefore the plants, to climatic zones where greater energy demand is expected.
